## Current Worktree Reality

The repository is implementing the larger `1.11.0 / versionCode 222` goal from the current `1.10.3 / 221` baseline. The Android widget requirements have already landed in the current baseline. The first `1.11.0` goal slice removes the former focus / pomodoro mode and prepares the database for later check-in and multi-group todo work. The second small `1.11.0` slice adds database schema export, debug-only Compose tooling, structured startup initialization, and AI-report retention cleanup. The navigation slice renames the drawer task entry to single-line `待办`, removes the drawer group expansion and standalone `分组管理` entry, and moves group filtering / group maintenance into the todo page chip bar. The multi-group slice implements multi-group todo relationships across phone UI, repository queries, backup/restore, desktop sync, and desktop Web todo management. The event check-in foundation slice adds event check-in data, backup, repository, and initial desktop-sync API foundations. The latest completed slice adds the phone event-editor `打卡追踪` switch and preserves optional event markers when moving events. The full `1.11.0` version bump is still pending.

Most important current baseline facts:

- Database version is now `18` in the working tree. `MIGRATION_17_18` drops the old `focus_sessions` table, creates `event_check_ins`, creates `todo_group_tags`, adds `checkInEnabled` and `totalCheckInMinutes` to `todo_items`, backfills todo group tags, and merges the old default `专注` group into `例行`.
- Active no-DDL todos are still treated as today todos across phone daily board, Android widget board query, desktop board, and desktop todo management.
- Countdown-enabled todos use their DDL time as the target; countdown-enabled events use their start time.
- Countdown targets whose exact target time has passed are filtered out before board / widget / desktop rendering.
- Planning Desk event import defaults to event-only. A linked todo is created only if the user explicitly enables the preview option.
- Planning Desk linked todos no longer receive a fixed auto-generated note.
- Planning Desk local parser and AI cleanup both treat `@地点` as event location text, not a required prefix or title content.
- Desktop-web event editor now exposes compact preset color swatches matching the phone editor.
- `今日看板` Android widget no longer renders its fixed top menu/title/date header; the RemoteViews list fills the widget body.
- `今日看板` and independent `倒数日` widgets both set `updatePeriodMillis=0` and use provider-owned `AlarmManager` minute ticks to refresh RemoteViews collections.
- Independent `倒数日` widget is now a scrollable `RemoteViewsService` / `ListView` widget rather than three fixed rows, with multi-line daily-board-style rows and direct todo/event detail deep links.
- Former focus / pomodoro mode is removed from the working tree: no drawer entry, settings block, FocusActivity, focus widget, focus DAO/repository API, desktop sync focus stats, AI-report focus fields, or backup focus-session export remains.
- Existing old backups that contain `focusSessions` are ignored rather than failing import.
- Room schema export is enabled and `app/schemas/com.example.todoalarm.data.AppDatabase/18.json` records the database-18 structure.
- Compose `ui-tooling-preview` is now scoped to `debugImplementation`, so release builds do not carry the preview tooling dependency.
- AI 日报 / 周报 settings include a report-retention dropdown; generating a report purges older archived reports according to 30-day / 90-day / 365-day / forever retention.
- Backup / restore preserves the AI report retention policy while still excluding AI API Keys.
- Application startup initialization uses an application-level `SupervisorJob` scope and records non-fatal initialization failures through `CrashLogger.recordNonFatal`.
- Desktop sync keeps the 4 MB request-body limit and returns HTTP 413 for oversized requests.
- Drawer navigation now shows `待办` as a simple module entry instead of expandable `我的任务`.
- Group filtering and group management now live in the todo page top chip bar: `全部`, each sorted group, and `新建`; long-pressing a group chip opens edit / delete behavior.
- Todos now support multiple group tags through `todo_group_tags`; phone and desktop todo filters use multi-select intersection semantics, while todo editors keep a primary `groupId` plus the full `groupIds` tag set.
- Backup / restore now includes `todoGroupTags`, and old backups without explicit tags are restored by backfilling from each todo's original `groupId`.
- Desktop sync todo payloads now expose and accept `groupIds`; desktop Web todo cards, previews, board rows, filter chips, and editor chips preserve multi-group relationships instead of collapsing them to one group.
- Calendar-event persistence now carries `checkInEnabled` and `totalCheckInMinutes`; repository APIs can check in, check out, list event check-ins, recompute total invested minutes, and query today's invested event minutes.
- Backup / restore now includes `eventCheckIns`, and deleting events clears their related check-in rows.
- Desktop sync event payloads now expose `checkInEnabled` / `totalCheckInMinutes`, and initial check-in endpoints exist at `GET /api/events/{id}/check-ins`, `POST /api/events/{id}/check-in`, and `POST /api/events/{id}/check-out`.
- Phone calendar-event editor now shows `打卡追踪` under `日程标记`; event move operations preserve both `countdownEnabled` and `checkInEnabled`.
- `node --check app/src/main/assets/desktop-web/app.js`, `./gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin`, and `git diff --check` have passed for the multi-group todo slice.
- `./gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin` and `git diff --check` have passed for the event check-in data / API foundation slice.
- `./gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin` and `git diff --check` have passed for the phone event-editor check-in switch slice.

## Immediate Manual Verification Targets

1. Android launcher widgets:
   - Add / resize `今日看板` and confirm there is no top header row.
   - Confirm `今日看板` content updates after minute ticks and across date changes.
   - Add / resize `倒数日` and confirm rows scroll, long titles wrap, and row taps open the matching todo / event detail.
2. Planning Desk local rule import:
   - `10:00-12:00 自习 @图书馆3楼`
   - `10:00-12:00, 【课程】习思想，"@主楼B1-412"`
   - `10:00-12:00 自习 地点：图书馆3楼`
3. Planning Desk AI import:
   - verify title, location, group, and linked-todo checkbox defaults.
4. Desktop web:
   - event color preset swatches update the color input and persist after saving.
   - todo multi-group filter chips use intersection filtering; editing a todo preserves all selected groups and cards / previews show all group names.
5. Regression:
   - normal event import does not create an unwanted todo;
   - manually linked todo has DDL equal to event end time and no fixed generated note.
6. Drawer / todo navigation:
   - drawer shows a single-line `待办`;
   - drawer has no expanded group list and no standalone `分组管理`;
   - todo page chip bar filters by group, `新建` creates a group, and long-press edits / deletes a group.
